![Coverage][coverage-badge] [![style: very good analysis][very_good_analysis_badge]][very_good_analysis_link] [![License: MIT][license_badge]][license_link]

Platform-independent lexer for the Dart programming language, written in Dart and based on the [Dart language specification][dart-lang-spec] (in case you really like Dart).

The goal of this project is to provide an easy-to-use lexer for Dart which will tokenize Dart source code without difficulty.

Made with blood, sweat, and tears by üê¥ Very Unofficial Ventures.
